🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)
Overview

This project is a Python implementation of Blackjack, a classic card game where players aim to get as close as possible to a hand value of 21 without going over.

The game simulates a standard Blackjack round with one dealer and a player. Each turn, the player chooses whether to hit (draw another card) or stand (end their turn), while the dealer follows a fixed set of rules. Final outcomes are determined by comparing each player’s hand against the dealer’s hand.

The project emphasizes modular design, clean game logic, and testable components.
